# Perceptron

* This project uses the MNIST dataset contained within Tensoflow 

  Steps of preceptron broadly - 

  1. provide perceptron with inputs for which there is a known answer 

  2. basis the weights which are randomly assigned and bias let perceptron guess the answer 

  3. Compute error 

  4. Adjust weights according to the error 

  5. return to step 1 as needed 

* The dataset containes images of numbers from zero to nine

* we will aim to identify them correctly
